# About
This application allows you to automatically deny gold at the end of your MultiVersus games. Configure what color you have set for the enemy and if you are playing 1v1 or 2v2. If the app detects you lost, it will automatically kill your game at the right time to send everyone back to the lobby.


# But Why?
Nothing is funnier than knowing the enemy team just got a "NoGoldForYou has disconnected" notification. Also this is for educational purposes only :-)
